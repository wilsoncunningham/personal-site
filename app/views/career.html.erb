    <p>
      I played baseball for almost my whole life, and I had the privilege of pursuing a career as a professional baseball player, a dream I had carried since I was a kid. Out of high school, I was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 2021 MLB Draft. The Cubs and I were able to come to a unique agreement: I would be able to pursue my education full-time while still playing in their Minor League organization—a detail in my contract that was fundamental to my personal success in these past years. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spending extended offseasons at school and away from the coaching and resources (and catch partners!) was frustrating at times, as I felt that I was falling behind in my performance. That being said, I am very grateful for my time at UChicago; I made some amazing friends, grew deeper in my faith, unlocked myriad opportunities, and I am now much wiser and resilient.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating college, I gave baseball my best shot, but in August 2025, my career came to an end. Due to struggles with ongoing injuries and my own performance on the field, I had not panned out to be the player I quite hoped to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite my career coming to an end sooner than I had hoped, I am immensely grateful for my experiences in professional baseball. Being in the Cubs orgnaizaiton for 4 years, I cultivated relationships with teammates, coaches, and other staff. I made friends, found mentors, learned valuable lessons, became more disciplined, principled, and healthy, and was able to do so while playing a sport I love.

  <div title="My Academic Interests" class="py-4">
    <h3 class="fire-red py-2"><em>My Academic Interests</em></h3>
    <p>
      I thrive when I am intellectually stimulated. I'm always curious; I love to challenge myself and learn new things. Though my academic interests are broad, I've always been particularly drawn to numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At UChicago, I earned my B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics, which was a great mix for me: pure math, statistics, and computer science. I was also able to specialize in Finance, which sealed all of my strongest interests into my major and gave me tangible tools for a future career.
    </p>
    <p>
      What made my time at UChicago truly special, though, was the breadth of subjects in the curriculum. Even as a STEM major, I took lots of humanities classes that allowed me to explore my interests beyond math. In those courses, I engaged deeply with history, art, literature, and philosophy, and I became a much stronger writer and thinker because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this website can be a genuine reflection of these interests: I'm sharing my passion for reading, I used my STEM skills to code this site from scratch, I spent a lot of time styling it to look just right, and I had a blast creating it.
