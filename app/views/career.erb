    <h3 class="fire-red"><em>My Baseball Journey</em></h3>
    <p>
      I’ve had the privilege of pursuing a career as a professional baseball player, a dream I’ve carried since I was young. Out of high school, I was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 2021 MLB Draft. The Cubs and I were able to come to a unique agreement: I would still be able to pursue my education full-time while still playing in their Minor League organization—a detail in my contract that has been fundamental to my personal success in these past years. 
      <br><br>
      Spending extended offseasons at school and away from the coaching and resources (and catch partners!) was frustrating at times, as I felt that I was falling behind in my performance. That being said, I am very grateful for my time at UChicago; I made some amazing friends, grew deeper in my faith, unlocked myriad opportunities, and I am now much wiser and resilient.
      <br><br>
      Now that I've graduated, I am giving baseball my best shot. With so many unknowns, I don't know how far baseball will take me, but I am doing all that I can to take my fullest advantage of this opportunity.
