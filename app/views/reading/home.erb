      Since finishing up my bachelor's in March, I have taken up the hobby of reading—but solely for my own enrichment this time around. While my reading journey is still budding, I have learned a lot so far, and I have a robust list of books I'd like to read in the future. Many people claim that they don't like to read, and I believe they are mistaken. What I have learned in my journey is that they simply have not yet discovered what they love to read.

        To help myself discover what I love to read and to simply keep track, I have kept a detailed log of what I have been reading, giving ratings for each of my reads.

        <em><u>A note:</u></em> To see my notes for each book, click on its row to expand it. My notes are very casual and my arguments may be left entirely unjustified. Treat these notes more as journal entries or reflections rather than formal reviews. I write these notes for myself to look back on, and I am posting them here as well simply as an invitation to thought. Finally, <span class="fire-red"><b><em>SPOILER ALERT:</em></b></span> My notes are filled with spoilers. I will thus leave them as drop-downs, only visible once clicked on.

              Incredible. Perhaps the best book I’ve ever read. East of Eden is a story about good and evil: sin, conquering sin, being engulfed in sin. Redemption, friendship, loss. It’s a story about Cain and Abel, about man and Christ.
              <br><br>
              East of Eden is the story of the fall of man and how we are to live as sinners, where can we look? What can we do? It is a story about Jesus: “And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.” Complete with incredible character arcs, endless great quotes, and a world of life lessons, East of Eden is the story. Thou mayest!

            The Old Man and the Sea<br>by Ernest Hemingway

            <div id="notes4" class="collapse mt-2 text-indent">
              After reading <em>East of Eden</em>, I wanted to read something very short. This was my first stab at Hemingway, whom I was very excited to read. I had previously heard about the masculine stoicism of Hemingway’s characters, especially in this book. I was looking forward to seeing if he lived up to the hype.
              <br><br>
              Unfortunately, I soon discovered that I do not like Hemingway’s linguistic style. The stripped-down, barren sentences devoid of punctuation left me bored and sometimes confused. His style made the book seem to drag on at a snail’s pace.
              <br><br>
              However, I loved the thematic content of this book. The old Cuban setting, the grit and stoicism of the Old Man, his struggle against the seemingly indomitable marlin. His grace under pressure and desire to press on. The ending was great: after his grueling journey which led to triumph and then ultimately brutal defeat, he calmly sets aside any self-doubt and plans for his next fishing outing. A true man.

            Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage<br>by Alfred Lansing

            <div id="notes2" class="collapse mt-2 text-indent">
              Cold, gritty, icy, windy, cold, wet, and cold. Shackleton’s leadership, the endurance of his men, navigational prowess. My eyes were super glued to this book for three days. Such an incredible story, almost unbelievable. And perfectly depicted by Lansing. The use of journal entries was great. Fast-paced, yet you feel the grueling freezing of time for these men. An inspiring read. Every man should read this book.

            1984<br>by George Orwell
            
            <div id="notes1" class="collapse mt-2 text-indent">
              How do we know what we are told is true? What happens when you go against everyone around you? Authoritarianism, suppression, truth, surveillance. In the second half of the book, we see Winston’s terrible torture and decay. We see a man completely crushed. His mind is chewed up, swallowed, and spat out again into something entirely different. At the end of the book, Winston is not even a shell of what he once was.
              <br><br>
              I had previously thought that people only liked <em>1984</em> because it calls out surveillance, totalitarianism, and fake news. These things only scrape the surface of the novel. Great read overall.
