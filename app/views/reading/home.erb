    Since finishing up my bachelor's in March, I have taken up the hobby of readingâ€”but solely for my own pleasure this time around. While my reading journey is still budding, it has been very exciting, and I have a robust list of book I'd like to read in the future. Many people claim that they don't like to read, and I believe they are mistaken. What I have learned in my journey so far is that they simply have not yet discovered what they love to read. To help myself discover what I love to read, I have kept a detailed log of what I have been reading, giving ratings for each of my reads.
