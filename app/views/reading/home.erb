      Since finishing up my bachelor's in March, I have taken up the hobby of reading—but solely for my own enrichment this time around. While my reading journey is still budding, I have learned a lot so far, and I have a robust list of books I'd like to read in the future. Many people claim that they don't like to read, and I believe they are mistaken. What I have learned in my journey is that they simply have not yet discovered what they love to read.

    <div class="col-9">
      <p>
        To help myself discover what I love to read and to simply keep track, I have kept a detailed log of what I have been reading, giving ratings for each of my reads.
        <br><br>
        <em><u>A note:</u></em> To see my notes for each book, click on its row to expand it. My notes are very casual and my arguments may be left entirely unjustified. Treat these notes more as journal entries or reflections rather than formal reviews. I write these notes for myself to look back on, and I am posting them here as well simply as an invitation to thought. Finally, <span class="fire-red"><b><em>SPOILER ALERT:</em></b></span> My notes are filled with spoilers. I will thus leave them as drop-downs, only visible once clicked on.

              Incredible. Perhaps the best book I’ve ever read. East of Eden is a story about good and evil: sin, conquering sin, being engulfed in sin. Redemption, friendship, loss. It’s a story about Cain and Abel, about man and Christ.
              <br><br>
              East of Eden is the story of the fall of man and how we are to live as sinners, where can we look? What can we do? It is a story about Jesus: “And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.” Complete with incredible character arcs, endless great quotes, and a world of life lessons, East of Eden is the story. Thou mayest!
